Neural Networks: Zero to Hero (A Course by Andrej Karpathy)

---

A course on neural networks that starts all the way at the basics. The course is a series of YouTube videos where we code 
and train neural networks.

**Lecture 1: The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd**

Backpropagation and training of neural networks. Assumes basic knowledge of Python and a vague recollection of calculus from high school.

**Lecture 2: The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore**

Implemented a bigram character-level language model. In this video, the focus is on (1) introducing torch.Tensor and its subtleties and use in efficiently
evaluating neural networks and (2) the overall framework of language modeling that includes model training, sampling, and the evaluation of a loss 
(e.g. the negative log likelihood for classification).
